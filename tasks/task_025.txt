# Task ID: 25
# Title: Load Testing and Performance Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct load testing to validate the system can handle 10,000+ users and meet performance requirements.
# Details:
1. Set up load testing environment
2. Create test scenarios for common user actions
3. Implement gradual load increase tests
4. Add stress testing for peak loads
5. Create endurance testing for sustained usage
6. Implement performance monitoring during tests
7. Add bottleneck identification
8. Create performance optimization recommendations
9. Implement database performance testing
10. Add API endpoint performance testing
11. Create real-time feature load testing
12. Implement final performance validation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with simulated 10,000+ concurrent users
2. Verify page load times remain under 2 seconds
3. Test database performance under load
4. Validate API response times under 500ms
5. Test real-time features with many connections
6. Verify system stability under sustained load
7. Test recovery from overload conditions
8. Validate final performance meets requirements
