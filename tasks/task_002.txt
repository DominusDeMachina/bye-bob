# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Schema Design and Migration System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a robust, version-controlled database schema in Railway.com (PostgreSQL) using modern Go practices. The solution should leverage golang-migrate for managing schema migrations, ensure best practices for schema evolution, and support maintainable, scalable development workflows.

Key requirements:
- Set up a Railway.com project and configure PostgreSQL connection
- Use golang-migrate to manage migration files and apply schema changes, enabling version control and repeatable deployments[5][2]
- Design the schema with clear table definitions, relationships, and constraints for core entities:
  - employees (id, first_name, middle_name, last_name, display_name, email, address, position_id, department_id, site_id, manager_id, employment_type, start_date, end_date, status, profile_picture_url)
  - positions (id, title, description, requirements)
  - departments (id, name, description, lead_id)
  - sites (id, name, city, address)
  - assessment_templates (id, name, description, version, active)
  - assessments (id, template_id, employee_id, reviewer_id, status, created_at, completed_at)
  - goals (id, employee_id, title, description, time_frame, type, status, created_at, updated_at)
  - goal_checkins (id, goal_id, note, progress, created_at)
  - audit_logs (id, user_id, action, table_name, record_id, changes, created_at)
- Establish foreign key relationships, constraints, and indexes for data integrity and performance
- Implement standard PostgreSQL security practices for access control
- Implement a PostgreSQL connection pool using pgxpool for efficient resource management
- Apply the repository pattern in Go to abstract database access, promote testability, and support clean architecture
- Document schema changes and migration processes for team collaboration

The implementation should follow modern Go conventions for database access, migration management, and schema design, ensuring maintainability and scalability for future development[5][2].

2. Migration execution details:
   - Successfully used golang-migrate to apply migration 004_security_config.up.sql
   - Verified migration success with database version check (confirmed at version 4)
   - Validated proper application of all security roles and policies

3. Active security configuration components:
   - Role-based access control with three distinct roles (byebob_app_role, byebob_admin_role, byebob_readonly_role)
   - Row-level security on sensitive tables functioning correctly
   - Controlled access to critical employee fields through proper policies
   - Default privileges configured for future database objects

9. Update CI/CD pipelines if needed to work with Railway.com

Implementation details:
1. Created comprehensive migration documentation in docs/supabase_to_railway_migration.md with detailed step-by-step instructions
2. Added/updated Railway.com specific documentation in docs/railway_setup.md
3. Updated database configuration in config/config.go to prioritize Railway connection string
4. Fixed compatibility issues between pgx v4 (used in database package) and pgx v5 (used in repository)

The migration approach preserves backward compatibility with existing code while preferring Railway.com when available. The PostgresConnectionString() function in config.go first checks for RAILWAY_DB_URL environment variable, and only falls back to individual connection parameters if not available.

All PostgreSQL repository implementations have been verified to work correctly with Railway.com. The connection test confirms successful connectivity to the Railway PostgreSQL instance and verifies the presence of the expected database tables.
