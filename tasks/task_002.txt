# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Schema Design and Migration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the database schema in Supabase (PostgreSQL) and create a migration system for version control of database changes.
# Details:
1. Set up Supabase project and configure connection
2. Implement migration system using golang-migrate or similar tool
3. Create initial migration files for core tables:
   - employees (id, first_name, middle_name, last_name, display_name, email, address, position_id, department_id, site_id, manager_id, employment_type, start_date, end_date, status, profile_picture_url)
   - positions (id, title, description, requirements)
   - departments (id, name, description, lead_id)
   - sites (id, name, city, address)
   - assessment_templates (id, name, description, version, active)
   - assessments (id, template_id, employee_id, reviewer_id, status, created_at, completed_at)
   - goals (id, employee_id, title, description, time_frame, type, status, created_at, updated_at)
   - goal_checkins (id, goal_id, note, progress, created_at)
   - audit_logs (id, user_id, action, table_name, record_id, changes, created_at)
4. Set up foreign key relationships and constraints
5. Implement indexes for performance optimization
6. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
7. Create database connection pool with pgxpool

# Test Strategy:
1. Test migration up and down functionality
2. Verify all tables are created with correct columns and constraints
3. Test foreign key constraints with sample data
4. Validate indexes improve query performance
5. Test RLS policies with different user roles
6. Benchmark connection pool performance under load
