The deployment involved addressing several implementation challenges and applying the security configuration through proper migration processes:\n\n1. Fixed issues in the Row-Level Security (RLS) policy implementation:\n   - Replaced problematic policy WITH CHECK clause that incorrectly referenced OLD and NEW\n   - Implemented a proper trigger function for sensitive field protection\n   - Added appropriate BEFORE UPDATE trigger on the employees table to enforce security rules\n\n2. Migration execution details:\n   - Successfully used golang-migrate to apply migration 004_security_config.up.sql\n   - Verified migration success with database version check (confirmed at version 4)\n   - Validated proper application of all security roles and policies\n\n3. Active security configuration components:\n   - Role-based access control with three distinct roles (byebob_app_role, byebob_admin_role, byebob_readonly_role)\n   - Row-level security on sensitive tables functioning correctly\n   - Controlled access to critical employee fields through proper policies\n   - Default privileges configured for future database objects\n   - Database users with appropriate permissions aligned with least-privilege principles\n\nThe implementation now provides a secure, least-privilege database access model for the ByeBob application while maintaining appropriate access levels for different user types.
